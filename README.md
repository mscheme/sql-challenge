# sql-challenge

See the HW_instructions.md for the homework instructions.

 http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com was used to create an ERD of the tables (provided via csv files in the data folder).
 
 Based on the ERD, a schema was created (schema.sql).
 The schema was used to create tables in a postgres database.
 The csv files were then imported into the postgres database tables.
 Lastly a series of queries were built and run based on prompts provided.
 
 BONUS:
 The tables from the postgres database were imported into Pandas.
 In Pandas they were merged and manipulated to create a bar chart showing the average salary by employee title.
